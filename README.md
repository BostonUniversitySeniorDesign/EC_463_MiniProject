# EC_463_MiniProject

We first started this project by downloading the Raspberry Pi to our SD card. After doing this, we connected the SD card to the Raspberry Pi and made sure that it was updated. We then decided to use a mobile phone hotspot to ensure the safety of our Kerberos passwords. After this, we updated python to make sure we had the latest version. After this, we moved on to scan the wifi. We decided to scan the wifi in the Senior Design Lab using the HDMI monitor due to the fact that it was the most convenient for us. 
	
We scanned the Wifi for 200 loops and for about 10 minutes. After doing so, we saved our JSON file and uploaded it to our github so we could access it on our laptops. Then, we used our JSON file and the "wifi_plot.py" code to plot the wifi that we collected. We had trouble at first accessing python on our MACs, but we later figured out how to access python through MiniConda. 
From the graph, on the X-axis, the time was recorded, and the y-axis was the amount of connections during that time.
